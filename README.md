# Turtle Crossing

A Python remake of the game Frogger where the goal is to cross the road while avoiding cars. 
For this the player can only move forward to avoid the cars, which only get faster as the player progresses.  

## How to Use

The files are written in standard Python that uses three modules: 
- turtle
- random
- datetime

All of these modules should be included with the standard Python libraries, so there shouldn't be any issues using these files in any Python environment.
The main file controls the screen and the calling of other elements. While the changing elements i.e. player, cars, scoreboard are controlled through their namesakes.
